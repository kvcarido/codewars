# Code Wars Challenges
Building the habit of learning in public. Also I realized that ~~there's no easy way to reference completed challenges directly from the website~~, so it'd be nice to have the logs. (I ended up finding the [completed solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/kcarido/completed_solutions) shortly after writing this. Still got'a do it for the ðŸŸ©)

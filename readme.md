# Code Wars Challenges
Building the habit of learning in public. Also I realized that ~~there's no easy way to reference completed challenges directly from the website~~, so it'd be nice to have the logs. **Update, I found the [Completed Solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/kcarido/completed_solutions) section of Code Wars, so I'm back tracking my words. Still going to continue pushing daily challenges here because green boxes.**
